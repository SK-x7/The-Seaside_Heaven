# The Seaside Heaven - A Next.js Learning Project

## About the Project

**The Seaside Heaven** is a web application built with **Next.js** and **Supabase** that allows users to book wooden cabins at a hotel. Users can view available cabins, make reservations, and manage their past bookings. This project was created as a learning experience while exploring **Next.js** and its ecosystem.
